# 2. Front-End

Recommended stack:

- React using Vite or Next.js
- TypeScript? Optional based on the student
- Definitely a UI library like Material-UI, TailwindCSS, or AntDesign
- **NO REDUX** (explained below)

## Duration

- Average for past successful students: 16 sessions
- 90th percentile: 23

## Expected Outcomes:

At the end of the module, the student:

✅ Understands the 3-tier architecture (client/server/db); responsibilities and limitations of each tier

✅ Can create fairly complex front-ends using React.js without help

✅ Is hireable as a junior front-end developer

✅ Has the project deployed and live (Github Pages, Vercel, etc.)

✅ Can effectively use AI coding agents (Cursor/Copilot) to accelerate React development, while maintaining good habits when working with AI agents, including code review and architectural control

## Topics

Below are the topics that we expect students to know by the end of this module:

- Basics: React components, State vs Props, JSX, rendering
- Class vs Functional
- Styling:
  - Inline
  - CSS files
  - styled-components
- React lifecycle
- Hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext
- Interactions between:
  - Parent to child
  - Child to parent
  - Independent components
- Debugging React:
  - Chrome devtools
  - Breakpoints
  - Console.log
- Organization
  - When to separating components
  - How to organize components, files and folders
  - React component hierarchy: Best practices
- Stateless components
- react-router

## AI Agent-Based Development

A key focus of this module is learning to effectively use AI coding agents like [Cursor Agent Mode](https://docs.cursor.com/agent) or GitHub Copilot Agent Mode (in preview). This is becoming an essential skill that employers expect. Throughout the module, students will:

### Tips

For coaches:

- Cursor has a good free tier
- Start this towards mid/end of the module
- Expect students to code using angets for a few sessions

For students:

- Always review and understand generated code
- Start with clear requirements and component design before engaging the AI
- Break down problems and solve them step by step vs. just asking for the whole thing. Example:
  - Start with a simple component
  - Add button 1
  - Add button 2
  - Add styling

## Avoid:

- React Performance Optimization
- Redux: We have tried redux with multiple students and they have suffered. The coaches regretted the decision too.
