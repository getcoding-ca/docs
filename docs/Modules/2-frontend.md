# 2. Front-End

Recommended stack:

- React using Vite
- TypeScript? Optional based on the student
- Definitely a UI library like Material-UI, TailwindCSS, or AntDesign
- **NO REDUX** (explained below)

## Duration

- Average for past successful students: 16 sessions
- 90th percentile: 23

## Expected Outcomes:

At the end of the module, the student:

✅ Understands the 3-tier architecture (client/server/db); responsibilities and limitations of each tier
✅ Can create fairly complex front-ends using React.js without help
✅ Is hireable as a junior front-end developer
✅ Has the project deployed and live (Github Pages)

## Topics

Below are the topics that we expect students to know by the end of this module:

- Basics: React components, State vs Props, JSX, rendering
- Class vs Functional
- Styling:
  - Inline
  - CSS files
  - styled-components
- React lifecycle
- Hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext
- Interactions between:
  - Parent to child
  - Child to parent
  - Independent components
- Debugging React:
  - Chrome devtools
  - Breakpoints
  - Console.log
- Organization
  - When to separating components
  - How to organize components, files and folders
  - React component hierarchy: Best practices
- Stateless components
- react-router

## Avoid:

- Performance optimization
- Redux: We have tried redux with 2 students and they both suffered. Both coaches regretted the decision.
