# 1. Intro to Web Dev

## Expected Outcomes:
At the end of the module, the student:
- Can set up and manage their future projects using github/vscode
- Gets into the habit of committing and pushing code frequently, ideally every day
- Can create simple web apps using html, css and vanilla JS
- Has a strong understanding of JS and programming logic, ready to move to ES6, React.js or Node.js

## Topics
Below are the topics that we expect students to know by the end of this module:
- Why developers use Git & Github
- Simple repo management: creating, cloning, committing, pushing
- Proper README
    - Description (what is it?) + link to the actual web page
    - Motivation (why this project?)
    - How to install/setup
    - How to run
- Github Pages
- Structure of a web page (html + css + js) and the role of each part
- Common HTML elements: headings, div, p, input
- CSS
    - Sizing and styling 
    - Important display options: block, inline, inline-block, flex, grid
    - Classes and IDs
    - Pseudo classes (:hover, :focus)
    - Selectors 
- Responsiveness (mobile friendliness)
- Basic Accessibility: alt, colour contrast, semantic tags (navbar, section)
- JavaScript
    - Variables: let, const, arrays, objects
    - Logic: if, switch, while, for
    - Functions
    - Accessing and modifying HTML using JS
    - Importing libraries using the `<script>`, e.g. bootstrap or axios
    - APIs 
        - Understanding the structure of an API call (request, response, address, method, status, body)
        - Making API calls
        - Parsing JSON
    - Related to the above: the asynchronous nature of JS (event driven)
- Debugging
    - Browser Developer Console
    - HTML/CSS inspector
    - Network inspector
    - JS Debugging using VSCode debugger + chrome

## Nice to Have's
- branching, merging, pull requests

## Project Guide:

Some tips:
- Check the #projects channel to see what others are doing
- No plain websites/portfolio (not enough JS)
- This is probably their first ever programming experience, keep it small in scope
- There are lots of open APIs (weather, stock, restaurants, movies)

There are 2 great ways of helping a student find a good project:

Asking them if during their day to day, or during their hobbies they wish there was a tool that would help them save time or would be great to have. Examples: 
- Eric’s Wheel Vision App: https://cahill-99.github.io/wheel-vision/ - Eric is a big car guy and his idea was that when he was wheel shopping he would like to see what his car looks like with different wheels. 
- Becca’s D&D Character Builder: Becca’s interest is Dungeons & Dragons, she always found that it took long to create NPCs and she also wanted to help new players easily build characters while also learning the game. So she built her own character builder with some guiding information as well as a “random” functionality to generate NPCs.
- Zad’s movie night picker: https://zadbabaei.github.io/MovieNights/  - Zad always found it hard to decide on what movie to watch when he was with his friends, so he build a movie poll that utilizes an API to pull in movies and let users vote on the movies they want to watch. 
Are there any cool projects related to their interests they might want to build (stock portfolio, crypto tracking etc.)
- Joel’s Fish Tank: https://joel1842.github.io/aquarium/ - Joel loves fish, and he wanted to recreate his fish tank in the virtual world. 
- Jarrod’s Crypto tracker: https://jarrodm-m.github.io/CryptoGraphs/ - Jarrod was interested in keeping track of his 3 favourite crypto currencies, so using an API he built himself a simple tracker.
