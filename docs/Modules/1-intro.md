# 1. Intro to Web Dev

## Duration

- Average for past successful students: 12 sessions
- 90th percentile: 19

## Expected Outcomes:

At the end of the module, the student:

- Can set up and manage their future projects using github/vscode
- Gets into the habit of committing and pushing code frequently, ideally every day
- Can create simple web apps using html, css and vanilla JS
- Has a strong understanding of JS and programming logic, ready to move to ES6, React.js or Node.js

## Topics

Below are the topics that we expect students to know by the end of this module:

- Why developers use Git & Github
- Simple repo management: creating, cloning, committing, pushing
- Proper README
  - Description (what is it?) + link to the actual web page
  - Motivation (why this project?)
  - How to install/setup
  - How to run
- Github Pages
- Structure of a web page (html + css + js) and the role of each part
- Common HTML elements: headings, div, p, input
- CSS
  - Sizing and styling
  - Important display options: block, inline, inline-block, flex, grid
  - Classes and IDs
  - Pseudo classes (:hover, :focus)
  - Selectors
- Responsiveness (mobile friendliness)
- Basic Accessibility: alt, colour contrast, semantic tags (navbar, section)
- JavaScript
  - Variables: let, const, arrays, objects
  - Logic: if, switch, while, for
  - Functions
  - Accessing and modifying HTML using JS
  - Importing libraries using the `<script>`, e.g. bootstrap or axios
  - APIs
    - Understanding the structure of an API call (request, response, address, method, status, body)
    - Making API calls
    - Parsing JSON
  - Related to the above: the asynchronous nature of JS (event driven)
- Debugging
  - Browser Developer Console
  - HTML/CSS inspector
  - Network inspector
  - JS Debugging using VSCode debugger + chrome

## Nice to Have's

- branching, merging, pull requests

## Some Tips:

- Don't spend too much time on HTML/CSS; focus on JS
- Use a UI after a few sessions to make the project look nice
- Check the #projects channel to see what others are doing
- This is probably their first ever programming experience, keep it small in scope
- There are lots of open APIs (weather, stock, restaurants, movies)
- Use localstorage to save data between sessions, e.g. API Keys, user's name
