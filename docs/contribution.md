# Contribution

The handbook is open-source and available in [this repo](https://github.com/getcoding-ca/handbook). Pull requests will be reviewed by Sahand for now. Feel free to suggest other approaches.

The handbook writing should be:

- Concise, but not robotic
- Fun and easy to read
- English... hahaha...
