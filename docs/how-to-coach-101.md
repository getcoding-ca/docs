# How to Coach 101

We want the coaching sessions to be as personal and natural as possible. No strict guidelines here, just some loose recommendations.

## The Program Structure
- [The Program Outline](https://www.getcoding.ca/outline)
- Each module is covered by a different coach to increase the student's exposure
- Weekly 1-hour meetings (online) between the coach and the student
- Slack messages in between to unblock or followup

## Your First Student
1. All students have done [a simple HTML/CSS project](https://www.getcoding.ca/admission-project) to get into the program. But some may know way more, e.g. python.
2. Some coaches like to schedule an initial 30-minute "intro" meeting to better know their student, their background, ambitions, ...
3. Your student is asked to [prepare for their first session](./Students/welcome.md) by learning git, vscode and thinking about their project for the first module
4. Schedule a 30-minute call with Sahand before your very first session
5. Read the [module reference](./Modules/intro%20to%20web%20dev.md) for your module

## Your First Session Probably Goes Like:
- Intro
- Talk about their project (more on this below)
- Teach new concepts, pair-program
- E.g. let's make a repository for your project and create the home page in basic html
- Give them some detailed tasks for next week
- Send them resources (youtube, how-to's, ...)

## Projects Are The Core of Get Coding
- The student MUST select the project
- You should control the scope so it's not too big/small
- Students should start working on their project on day 1
- The project becomes the curriculum. Start from the simple things (h1, div, etc.) to more complex parts (javascript). 
- For example, in the first modules students generally create the basic HTML/CSS structure of their project in the first week
- This gets students into the habit of coding vs. watching a udemy course for 20 hours

Check out the #projects channel in slack to see some examples of what projects other students are doing.

## Treat the student as a junior developer
Imagine they are a junior developer who just joined your company and you are their mentor/supervisor. This means:
- Guide them, but don’t solve their problems
- Teach them to use Google, docs, … before asking for help
- Try to connect with them. Talk about their/your hobbies, day-to-day, goals.


## Frequent Commits
The student should commit/push from day one and then every day they code, even if it’s a 1 line change.

This helps them build an [active GitHub account](https://github.com/adam-paul952/) and get comfortable with coding.

## Do What YouTube Can't Do
- Help set up their dev environment
- Code reviews, best practices, discussing different approaches
- Providing them with good resources (youtube, docs, articles, books, etc.)
- Connecting what you do at work to what they are learning

## House Keeping / Payments
- Please message Jan and send him a pro picture, your title, company and technologies you are an expert in. It’s going on our website [like this](https://www.get-coding.ca/our-instructors).

- Use the Get Coding app ([Web](https://app.getcoding.ca/), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.getcoding.app), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/6444653874)) to log your sessions and get paid.

- Feel free to use the Slack channel to chat with any of the other students or coaches, promote events, share resources or jobs, etc.
