# ⚡️ Prepare for React

## Project

Some students choose to do a complex project (front-end with React, back-end with Node in the next module). Some students choose to do a front-end only project with React, e.g. a game. Whichever you choose:

- Write a project proposal:
  - What is it?
  - Target Audience
  - Must-have Features
  - Nice-to-have Features
  - [Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxV89oTqurjmpwovcgrg_n9L7D9EQ83w/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103453500244994698980&rtpof=true&sd=true)
- Wireframe it

Here are some of the react projects other students have built:

- [Chorebucks, incentiving kids to do chores by Mike Miller](https://www.chore-bucks.com/)
- [Pricewatcher, a Runescape exchange price monitoring tool by Dennis Kean](https://djkean.github.io/pricewatcher)
- [Nurse Assignment Management by Hiba Mohamed](https://hiba-mohamed.github.io/Reactjs-Nurses-Assignment-Sheet/)
- [SoSep, 2-player Backgammon game by Soheil Najmabadikia](https://soheilnk.github.io/Backgammon/)
- [OA, a music album production management software by Evan Watton](https://ao-demo.vercel.app/)

## Prepare mentally

This module is a lot to take in. If you feel overwhelmed, that's normal.

## Prepare technically

Here are some resources our coaches recommend to prepare for React:

1. [What is react? Why does it exist? Why is it so popular?](https://ui.dev/c/react/why-react)
2. Learn some JavaScript syntax features that are common in React:

- Arrow Functions
- Template Literals
- Promises, Async/Await
- Spread Operator
- Destructuring
- [Useful array function](https://www.willandskill.se/sv/articles/7-javascript-es6-array-functions-you-must-know)

3. [Install Node](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-installing-node-js)
4. [Setup your first react project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-setting-up-a-react-environment)
5. Follow a very simple and short React tutorial
