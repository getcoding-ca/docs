# Career Module Summary

## Employers care about...

1. Soft skills and culture fit: are you a good person to work with?
2. Technical skills: can you do the job?

You're amazing on both fronts, but employers don't know that yet...

1. Networking: gets the employer to notice you
2. Portfolio: gets you the interview
3. Interview: gets you the job

## Getting a Job

### 1. Networking

- Employers hate posting jobs: expensive, time-consuming, risk of bad hire
- They rather hire from their network
- So 80% of jobs are not posted anywhere, they are filled through the network
  - "Hey, do you know anyone who can do XYZ?"

Which means that you have to network:

- Events: hackathons, meetups, networking, talks, ...
- LinkedIn
- Targetted cold outreach

### 2. Portfolio

In the absence of formal work experience, you convince employers with a strong portfolio.

import experience from '@site/static/img/experience.jpeg';

<img src={experience} style={{maxWidth: "400px"}} /><p></p>

The meme above rings true for most fields, but not for tech. You can build your own experience by working on external projects:

- Find a newly formed startup that needs a website/app
- Find a non-profit that needs your help
- Family/friends with a business
- Local business needing your skills

The best applicants look like this:

- Has some **real** external projects, e.g. an app for XYZ org
- Projects are complex
- Projects look nice
- An active Github

- Optionally, you can create a portfolio website to showcase everything
