    - Task: what was your role/task?
    - Action: tell me something you did that was impressive / you are proud of
    - Result: what was the result of that action?
    - Example: I joined Schlumberger after graduating from school. As a field technical, my role was to install and maintain electrical equipments used in the field. I'm proud to have followed all safety procedures and never had an accident. As a result, we created a safe work environment for everyone and passed all safety audits with ease.

## Important Note

:::danger
Do not apply anywhere without discussing it with Sahand or Jan.

There have been students who apply with terrible resumes, and naturally they get rejected. Then they get discouraged and stop applying. Then they graduate without a job.
