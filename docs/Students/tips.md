So you've been in the program for a few weeks. Here are some tips to make the most of it:

#### Commit and push every day that you code

import github from '@site/static/img/github.png';

<img src={github} style={{maxWidth: "700px"}} />

Every commit/push adds a green square to your GitHub profile. After the program, this will show employers all the hard work and patience you've put in, and your future self will thank you.

#### Get used to Googling

import google from '@site/static/img/google.jpg';

<img src={google} style={{maxWidth: "500px"}} />

import google2 from '@site/static/img/google2.webp';

<img src={google2} style={{maxWidth: "300px"}} />

<p></p>

There is an endless stream of memes on this topic. Senior developers with 15 years of experience Google the simplest things. It is completely normal.

When copying someone's code into your project, make sure you understand what every single character of code is doing. You should have full understanding of how your project works.

Why do developers depend on Google so much?

1. Most developers use a variety of languages/frameworks/tools on a day-to-day basis. For example, I just used the following at work today: css, react, node, git, aws, markup. It is simply impossible to know all of these technologies by heart.

2. Software technologies change rapidly. For example, React.js did not exist 6-7 years ago. Now it used in many companies. So even senior developers are new to it and have to rely on Google/youtube/tutorials to learn new emerging technologies. A few years from now, another technology will replace this too. So, there is just no end to learning software development. 

3. Software developers don't build the same thing over and over. A software developer works on feature A, then feature B, then a bug, then a different bug, then another product, then another company. It is almost always a new different thing that you have never done before.

We are not trying to teach you every detail of "html/css/js". That would be pointless. We are actually teaching you <b>how to learn a new programming language/framework and utilize it to build software</b>.

#### Coding Is Not Typing

You've seen programmers in movies write code faster than a court typist? Well...

Most of your time as a software developer just goes into figuring things out:  Googling, reading the docs, reading your own code, starring at the screen in disappointment, hitting refresh ðŸ˜‚ That's normal.

#### Consistency > Intensity

Just like learning a new instrument or going to the gym, you cannot cram it. It doesn't work if you code 60 hours one week, then do nothing another week. It's about consistency: +15 hours/week for 12 months

#### Trust The Process

Every single student who has completed the program has reached their career goals. It works as long as you give it +15 hours/week and follow our advice.
