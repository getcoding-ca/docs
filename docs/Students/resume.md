# How to create a resume

## Resume Contents

Generally speaking, you want your resume and linkedin to match as much as possible. However, resume should be shorter. Most students at Get Building should be able to get their resume in 1 page, or max 2. Definitely not 3.

Make edits to your resume to match the particular job posting you are sending it for.

These are the important sections in a resume:

Primary sections:

- Intro
- Work experience, 0 to 1-2 that are relevant
- Education including Get Building
- Projects, 2-3 that are relevant, with links
- Skills

Other important info:

- Email
- Github
- Linkedin
- Get Building Webpage
- Portfolio site if you have one

## Resume Design

I cannot stress enough how important the design of your resume is. It is the first impression you make on the recruiter. An ugly resume is like wearing a dirty shirt to an interview. A beautiful resume is expected in the tech sector.

## How To

Your resume is best to be in doc format, and exported to PDF when necessary. For example, search for "modern word resume templates" and pick one you like.

::: tip
Don't use Canva, Figma or other design tools to create your resume. It will make it not parseable by the ATS (Applicant Tracking System) that most companies use.
