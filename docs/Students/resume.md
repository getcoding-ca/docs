# How to create a resume

:::info
This guide is only for those who have completed the _Career Switching Preparation Module_.
:::

## 1. Contents of the Resume

We will be using the contents of your LinkedIn profile in the resume almost identically. You only need to make minor edits to shorten paragraphs or to emphasize certain skill sets for a particular job posting.

If your LinkedIn is not updated, update it first.

## 2. Creating the Resume

We use the Figma application for resume writing. Figma is mainly a design tool, but we use it because the end result will end up looking a lot better than Word.

Steps:
1. Create an account in [Figma.com](https://www.figma.com)
2. Open [this link](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1146516158149783580)
3. Press "Get a copy" at the top
4. Start editing

**To change the photo** double click on the photo multiple times until a small panel appears. Hover over the photo in the panel and press "Choose Image".

:::warning
If your photo file size is too large, the final PDF file will also be too large.
:::

**To change the text** double click on the text until you are in the editing mode.

**To add a new section** click on a section, copy and paste using the keyword.

:::warning
When editing the links on the left, make sure to also edit the destination URL. Hover over the link and press edit to change the destination URL.

### 3. Export to PDF

When you are done editing, 

1. Select the whole thing (the Frame)
2. Scroll to the bottom of the right panel and press "Export Frame"
3. Ensure everything looks fine and the links work correctly
