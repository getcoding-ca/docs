# Tips for Success

So you've been in the program for a few weeks. Here are some tips to make the most of it:

## Maintain an Active Github

import github from '@site/static/img/github.png';

<img src={github} style={{maxWidth: "700px"}} />

<p></p>

Every commit/push adds a green square to your GitHub profile. After the program, this will show employers all the hard work and patience you've put in, and your future self will thank you.

## Googling is Expected

import google2 from '@site/static/img/google2.webp';

<img src={google2} style={{maxWidth: "300px"}} />

<p></p>

There is an endless stream of memes on this topic. Senior developers with 15 years of experience Google the simplest things. It is completely normal.

When copying someone's code into your project, make sure you understand what every single character of code is doing. You should have full understanding of how your project works.

## Stuck? That's normal.

Unlike movies, most of your time as a software developer just goes into figuring things out: Googling, reading the docs, reading your own code, staring at the screen in disappointment, hitting refresh ðŸ˜‚ That's normal.

Take a break, write what you want to happen on paper in great detail, debug your code line by line, ask for help, ...

## Consistency > Intensity

Just like learning a new instrument or going to the gym, you cannot cram it. It doesn't work if you code 60 hours one week, then do nothing another week. You need to code consistently every week for the duration of the program.

## Don't Compare Yourself to Others

It's self-fulfilling prophecy. If you think you are not good enough, you'll never take the chances and challenges that improve you, and you will not be good enough. If you think you are good enough, you will be good enough. You are good enough.
