# Preparation

While waiting to connect with your coach and have your first session, you can do a few things to speed up your learning:

### 1. Install necessary tools

- Download and Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Make a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account

### 2. Git and Github

Learn what Git and Github are and why they are important:

1. [What is Git?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ReR1YJrNOM)
2. [What is Github then?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caHOmK9kFfI)
3. [Install](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
4. [How to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdAHXoRtos)

We should have one GitHub account, but a separate repository for each of your projects.

### 3. Start working on your project

1. Create a repository for your project
2. Start building the HTML/CSS structure of your project

Doesn't have to be perfect, any progress will save you time later.

### 4. Learn more Git, HTML, CSS and JavaScript

We recommend [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)
