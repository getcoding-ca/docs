# üëè Completing the Intro Module

To complete module 1, you should post your project to the #projects channel and apply the feedback:

- Write a 1 sentence pitch, e.g. "An app that helps with chess opening moves"
- Share the live link to your project (Github Pages) and repo
- Make sure your project has the title, description and image [OG tags](https://medium.com/geekculture/open-graph-tags-in-html-101-5d470bbdb78a)
- Optional: record a 1 minute demo
  - Nobody watches more than 30 seconds (trust me)
  - You can use [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) to record your screen and voice
- Thank your coach

## Apply the feedback

- Feedback from Sahand or Jan should be applied (unless specified)
- All bugs and issues should probably be fixed

Applying the remaining feedback is up to your coach and your own judgement.

## What's next?

1. Your coach will complete an evaluatation
2. We will make a decision on accepting you to phase 2

If you don't hear from us within 1 week, please reach out to us on Slack.

## After you are accepted:
