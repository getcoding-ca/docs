### Slack

1. Install Slack's on your computer and phone
2. Update your name/profile picture. Take a nice photo if you don't have one.
3. Introduce yourself in the #casual channel. Include your background, why you joined Get Coding, hobbies, fun facts, etc.

### Expectations

Let's set some expecations. We expect you to:

- Code +15 hours a week consistently
- Not to take long breaks from the program
- Maintain a great relationship with your coach

You can expect us to:

- Match you with qualified coaches for 1-on-1 coaching sessions
- Give you honest feedback
- Help you when you need it

### Prepare Mentally ðŸ˜‡

Let's hear from some of our past students:

> "It will 100% feel overwhelming at times but you're in good hands and never hesitate to ask questions." <br/> Andrew Reynolds, Software Developer at NetBenefit

> "The biggest advice is just to keep working on it, it will come." <br/> Joel Lake, Software Developer at Enaimco

The journey you are about to take is DIFFICULT, but also very ACHIEVABLE. It will feel overwhelming and impossible, which is what every student feels. A few months later, you'll be laughing at how simple it all was. It's just a matter of putting the time in to allow your brain to absorb all the new knowledge and get used to it. In the words of Robert Frost: "The only way out is through."

The following tools will help in this journey:

- A schedule to stick to
- A project that you are super passionate about
- A commitment to making progress on your project, however big or small, week by week

:::info
Normal: feeling overwhelemd, confused, frustrated, or demotivated.<br/>
Cause for Concern: not enjoying coding, feeling burnt out, or depressed.

## Evaluation Criteria

Below are some areas where our past successful students excelled at. We will also evaluate you through the same lens:

- Commitment: how much you code, how fast you progress, your github activity
- Great communication
- Your coach's review of you
- Project: complexity, aesthetics, creativity
- Community: attending events, being active in Slack, sharing your progress, helping others

We will do a "soft" evaluation 6 weeks into the program so you know what you need to improve upon by the end of the first module.

## Next Step

Now you need to think of a project idea to be assigned a coach:
